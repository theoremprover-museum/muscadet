The Muscadet theorem prover is a knowledge-based system.
It is based on natural deduction, and uses methods which resemble those used
by humans.
It is composed of an inference engine, which interprets and executes rules,
and of one or several bases of facts, which are the internal representations
of “theorems to be proved”.
Rules are either universal and put into the system, or built by the system
itself by metarules from data (definitions and lemma s) given by the user.


directions for use (also in muscadet.html) 
------------------
manual-en.pdf is the user's manual 
muscadet-en is the complete Prolog file 
musca-en is a Unix script, which allows to start it;i
 you must then call one of the commands prove, tptp , casc or th 
th-en.c and tptp-en.c are small C files which allow to work under Linux 
examples is a directory of examples (data example* and proofs res_*) 

The Prolog used is SWI-Prolog, which is freeware under an L-GPL license,
downloaded at the following address http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html 
and which is called by the command /usr/bin/swipl

In all cases, you have to be in a directory that contains the Prolog file
muscadet-en (or a link with the same name to this file).
Then 

1. Direct proof of a theorem T (under Prolog) 
-----------------------------
Call the Unix script musca-en .
You are then under SWI-Prolog and the file muscadet-en is loaded. 
type prove(T). 
before, if necessary, 
assert(definition(D)). and/or assert(lemma(Nom,L)).
then buildrules. 

2. Proofs from files containing theorems, definitions and lemmas in the form
----------------------------------------------------------------
theorem(Nom,T).
definition(D).
lemma(Name,L). 

2.1. Under Prolog (called by musca-en which loads muscadet-en), 
     ------------
call th(File [,Options]). or th. for detailed instructions 

2.2. Under Linux
----------------
compile the file th-en.c, executable th
call th file [options] or th for detailed instructions 

3. Proof of one theorem of the TPTP library ( http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp ) 
-------------------------------------------

3.1. Under Prolog (called by musca-en which loads muscadet-en),
-----------------
call tptp(File [,Options]). 
or tptp(Name[,Options]). 
or tptp. for detailed instructions 

3.2. Under Linux
----------------
compile the file tptp-en.c, executable tptp
call tptp path [options]
ou tptp for detailed instructions 

4. Results
----------
in the direct case (1.), on the standard output
otherwise (2. et 3.) in files named 
rul_<name of the theorem or of the TPTP problem TPTP>
